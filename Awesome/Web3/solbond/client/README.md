## Prerequisites

- npm is needed to install packages.
- Node.js is needed to run Solbond.

### Ubuntu

Install Node.js and npm on your machine running Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm
```
### Windows 

Use the official links for downloading on Windows:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Run the following commands to confirm if the installation was successful:

```bash
$ node --version
$ npm --version 
```

## Installation

Then install the node-modules in package.json:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Configuration 

You'll need to build and deploy the program before continuing. To do so, go through the [Program README](https://github.com/Araekiel/solbond/tree/master/program#readme). In case you wish to use the program already deployed on devnet, take note of the following specs: 

```js
{
    solana_network_endpoint: "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
    solana_network_commitment: "processed", // you can change this as per your wish
    program_id: "437pvxJrLfiZefAR3skQGrPZe7nXzPrJ4SMMnmhfkSav"
}
```

Make a file called **env.store.js** in **src/store** directory. Within this file write the following code:

```js
import { readable } from 'svelte/store';

export const connectionConfig = readable({
    endpoint: *solana_network_endpoint*,
    commitment: *solana_network_commitment*,
});

export const programID = readable(*program_id_of_deployed_program*);
```

## Run & Build

> Change the port in the **start** script within **package.json**. Default port is **_108_**.

Run the client with the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Run the client with livereload enabled with the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open a browser and type **localhost:_port_**

Build the client with the following command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
