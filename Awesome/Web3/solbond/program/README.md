## Prerequisites

- Rust is needed for obvious reasons.
- Solana Command Line Tools are needed to build the *_.so_* file and run the local test-validator (if needed).

#### Install the requisites:

- Install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Install Solana CLI tools by following the tutorial at [https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

> WSL is recommended if you are using Windows. To install and setup WSL 2 follow the tutorial at [https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

## Build & Deploy 

Building the program is fairly easy: 

- Open your terminal (wsl if on windows) and run:

```bash
cargo build-bpf
```

- A *_.so_* file will be generated at the location mentioned in the output.

To deploy the program: 

- Make sure your Solana CLI config is set to the endpoint you desire.
- Make sure your wallet has enough *_SOL_*, if not, airdrop what is needed. 
- Run the following command: 

```bash
solana program deploy *path_to_.so_file*
```

- Note the Program ID. It will be needed when running the Client.
