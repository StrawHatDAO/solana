## About

This project was made as a submission for the on-chain wedding track by [Superpumped](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi-pkXLbm7sqXFhV1NBLUfQ) in the 'Building out Loud' Hackathon by Solana.
This repo contains code for both, the Solana Program built with Rust and the client built with Svelte, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

## Notes 

- Features expected to be on an on-chain wedding dApp but do not exist on Solbond:
    - Shared assets account - The solana program already creates an account to store each solbond's state, the same account can be used as shared asset accounts.
    - Annulment - Upon annulment the above mentioned account can be dissolved and the assets can be divided among the partners.
    - KYC - on-chain or off-chain KYC is needed to make a dApp that solves this particular problem, legally viable.

- Misc 
    - Any error encountered when sending a transaction, e.g. not enough balance in the wallet, displays the same, vague error message: 'Transaction resulted in an    error'. I'll fix this later.
    - Solbond stores data on-chain, services like arweave and IPFS are (obvious) better alternatives.  

## Prerequisites

#### for running the dApp locally:

- General 
    - Git is need to clone the repository on your machine.

- Client: 
    - npm is needed to install packages.
    - Node.js is needed to run the client.

- Program 
    - Rust and Solana CLI tools are needed to build the program and run a test-validator.

#### for using the dApp:

- 2 Sollet wallets are needed to use the dApp (Only sollet is supported currently).

## Setup 

- Follow the [Client README](https://github.com/araekiel/solbond/tree/master/client#readme) to setup the client.

- Follow the [Program README](https://github.com/araekiel/solbond/tree/master/program#readme) to setup the program.


## Deployment

Solbond's client is currently deployed on Vercel, and the program is deployed on devnet.
